I decided to convert the Ender 3 v2 into an EnderWire.
I used the Siboor guide and the original Swtichwire guide for assembly.
It is not a kit but all self source.
I decided to include everything I can, in case anyone needed inspiration or a starting point.
It is currently still a work in progress because I am not 100% finished modifying and setting it up.
